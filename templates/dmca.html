                {{ SITE_NAME }} does not host or stream any video files. All content is hosted on third-party platforms. {{ SITE_NAME }} merely acts as a search and aggregation tool and does not control or store content from these providers.

                We may use proxy services to relay video streams from these platforms. This ensures we act only as a technical intermediary and don't store video content ourselves. We have no control over the content, legality, or availability of videos hosted by third-party platforms. Responsibility for content lies with the original creators and the hosting platforms.
